You can create an object to class as

class_name obj=new class_name();

java.lang is the default package, that comes automatically, no need to import them. 

All classes are derived from root class called java.lang.Object 

Control Structures : 
_____________________

Used to define the flow of the program. 

There are 2 types of control structures known as 

	(i) Branching 

	  if...else : Executes the statements based on the condition. 

		if(condition) {
		  statements;
	        } else {
	          statements;
	        }

       (ii) Looping 

	while loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. For every loop, basically there are 3 phases known as 

	(i) Initialization 

       (ii) Condition 

      (iii) Increment or Decrement 

Initialization performed at the beginning of the loop. 

Condition performed at the conditional part of the loop. 

Increment/Decrement performed before closing the loop. 

while(condition) {
 ...
 ...
}

for loop : Executes the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

for(initilization;condition;increment/decrement) {
   statements;
}


switch...case : Used to define menu-driven programs. 

In Java, strings are immutable. means once they are assigned we cannot change the value by using any string methods. 

Arrays : 
  
An array is the finite ordered set of homogeneous elements, means all the elements belongs to same data type. 

All the elements of the array are stored in successive memory locations. 

declaration : 

int[] a=new int[]{12,5,7,44};

a[0]=12;
a[1]=5;
a[2]=7;
a[3]=44;


int[] a=new int[]{12,5,77,34,23,73};
		
		System.out.println("Elements of Array are  ");
		
//		for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++) {
//			System.out.println(a[i]);
//		}
		
		for (int i : a) {
			System.out.println(i);
		}

In the above foreach loop, at first i points to the first element in array A, after processing the first element, it checks next element is there or not by using hasNext(), if hastNext() returns true, it moves to the next element by using next(), it repeats as soon as hasNext() returns false.
